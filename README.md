# Algorithms



I have coded the following algorithms so far:



- Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
- Minimum Spanning Trees
  - Prim's Algorithm
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
- Huffman Compression
- Minimax with Alpha Beta Pruning
- Knapsack Problem



I am currently working on Maze Navigation with BFS



All the algorithms were written in a mixture of C and C++, (The legacy C folder is the code I wrote when I was learning C++, hence it has a lot of C concepts). The legacy code **made not work**, but the code in the Algorithms folder has been tested and works.
